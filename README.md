-- What is Jupyter? (from Wiki)
-- Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents.
   Jupyter Notebook can connect to many kernels to allow programming in different languages. A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of 
   requests (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply.
